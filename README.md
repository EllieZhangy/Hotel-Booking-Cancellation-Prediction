# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction
This project will mainly focus on leveraging data mining techniques to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bookings to address the business needs of customers and also build models to predict whether a booking will be canceled.

## Data Source: 
Hotel Booking Demand Datasets: Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, Luis Nunes, Data in Brief, 2019

## Techniques Used:
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This would involve looking at the distribution of the data, identifying any missing values, and visualizing the relationships between features using plots such as scatterplots and histograms.
 - Clustering: K-Means & DBSCAN
 - Time series analysis: identify trends in booking demand or cancellation over time, such as seasonal patterns and fluctuations.
 - Predictive modeling(Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,XGBoost etc.): forecast future bookings or cancellation based on past data.
